## Description
I built this in order to get a better understanding on handlebars.js and to create a functioning blog with authentication. My motivation was to understand different ways to create pages, more knowledge on how to create an authentication process, and processing data to produce posts under specific users . I learned how to put all these concepts together to produce a real life example of a blog posting system.

2. Install packages by typing npm i into thee terminal to produce the package
3. Type in npm start and the server will start on port 3004
